# Results (tracked)

This folder contains small, presentation-ready outputs committed to GitHub (tables, plots, and selected Grad-CAM examples).

Large artifacts are intentionally not committed:
- dataset (`data/`)
- checkpoints (`checkpoints/`)
- full run logs (`runs/`)

Start here:
- Results report (summary + conclusions): `REPORT.md`
- Figure index (each image meaning + conclusion): `FIGURES.md`
